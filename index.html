  Police, businesses and community leaders find different ways to tackle rising old-school graffiti in East Bronx

      <p> On the walls directly beneath the elevated subway tracks in Bronx Park East, a thick, yellow bubble font with a black outline spells out “Cous.”
      </p>
      <p>On mailboxes throughout Van Nest, and on the side of a school bus, in all capitals, thin black markings spell “BONE.” And on a brick wall in the same neighborhood, light-blue paint spells “Mr. Broccoli,” below a drawing of a broccoli crown with
        a smiley face. The head of the broccoli looks like a puff of smoke.
      </p>
      <p>Graffiti is on the rise in Van Nest and Bronx Park East, to the frustration of the locals – especially older residents, who see it as a reminder of a seedier New York of the ’80s and ’90s. The police have stepped up their response to the graffiti,
        which many see as pure vandalism and not as art. But the police’s clean-up efforts aren’t effective enough for some community organizers and business owners, who’ve taken matters into their own hands. And these same leaders don’t view arrests
        as effectual punishments.

      <p>
        The type of graffiti that’s reappearing is an “old-school” style of “tagging” and “bubble letters,” serving as another reminder of former decades. An artist duo known simply as Izzy and Mar are experts who conduct graffiti tours in Bushwick, Brooklyn.
        Mar explained the style as “bombing,” meaning the tagging of walls all over a certain neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>He said that writing your “tag” is about ego, bravado and competition between crews. But more than that, it’s an expression of identity. “You’re dealing with communities that a lot of times feel they’re being forgotten about,” said Mar. “They’re
        trying to earn respect, you know?”
      </p>
      <p>At a recent police precinct meeting, Officer Tyrone Mederos explained the urgency for tackling this type of graffiti. “A lot of people who are complaining about it lived in the ’80s. So they understand how pervasive graffiti can be,” he said. “So
        they’re afraid that if we don’t stop it now, it’ll just get worse.”
      </p>

      <p>He said some see graffiti as part of the “broken windows theory,” which suggests that tackling smaller crimes reduces the atmosphere of lawlessness, and in turn prevents bigger crimes.
      </p>
      <p>That’s why the 49th Precinct has specifically appointed a graffiti coordinator, Officer Ron Lewis, whose role involves looking for new graffiti, and analyzing patterns within it, to link it to an offender. He also organizes community clean-ups,
        where volunteers help him erase the graffiti with paint thinner, then repaint a fresh coat.
